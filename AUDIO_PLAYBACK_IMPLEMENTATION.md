# Audio Playback Implementation Summary

## Overview

Implemented a complete audio playback system using the voice generation API with play/pause functionality and dynamic icon changes.

## Key Changes

### 1. Audio Generation Service (`lib/app/services/audio_generation_service.dart`)

**Changes Made:**

- Extended `GetxController` to make it reactive
- Added observable properties:
  - `isPlaying`: Tracks if audio is currently playing
  - `currentPlayingText`: Tracks which message text is being played
- Added audio player instance: `_currentPlayer`
- **Removed all timeout limits** from API calls
- Implemented new methods:
  - `togglePlayPause()`: Toggle between play and pause for a specific text
  - `_playAudio()`: Internal method to play audio with state management
  - `pauseAudio()`: Pause current audio
  - `resumeAudio()`: Resume paused audio
  - `stopAudio()`: Stop and dispose audio player
  - `isPlayingText()`: Check if a specific text is currently playing

**Key Features:**

- No timeout on API calls (removed 30-second limits)
- Automatic state tracking with reactive observables
- Proper cleanup on service disposal
- Single audio player instance (stops previous audio before playing new one)

### 2. Home Controller (`lib/app/modules/home/controllers/home_controller.dart`)

**Changes Made:**

- Changed `AudioGenerationService` to a singleton instance registered with GetX
- Renamed `readAloud()` to `toggleReadAloud()`
- Added `isTextPlaying()` method to check playing state
- Made `audioService` public for widget access

### 3. Custom Chat Bubble Widget (`lib/resources/widgets/custom_chat_bubble.dart`)

**Changes Made:**

- Removed `onReadAloudPressed` callback parameter
- Added `GetBuilder<HomeController>` with `Obx` for reactive updates
- Dynamic icon based on playing state:
  - `Icons.volume_up`: When not playing (default state)
  - `Icons.pause_circle`: When audio is playing
- Automatically calls `controller.toggleReadAloud(text)` on button press

### 4. Messages List Widget (`lib/app/modules/home/widgets\messages_list.dart`)

**Changes Made:**

- Removed `onReadAloudPressed` parameter when creating `CustomChatBubble`
- Simplified widget instantiation

## How It Works

1. **User clicks volume icon** on AI message bubble
2. **Widget checks** if audio is already playing for that message
3. **If not playing:**
   - Shows loading dialog
   - Sends text to API without timeout
   - Receives audio URL
   - Starts playback
   - Icon changes to pause button
4. **If playing:**
   - Pauses the audio
   - Icon changes back to volume icon
5. **Automatic cleanup** when audio completes or user navigates away

## API Integration

**Endpoint:** `POST /chatbot/audio-generate/`

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "text": "message text",
  "user_type": "platinum",
  "voice_type": "Soothing_female"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "audio_url": "http://example.com/media/audio_files/dream_xxx.mp3"
}
```

**Features:**

- No timeout limits
- Automatic URL normalization (handles relative and absolute URLs)
- Authorization header support
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

## Benefits

✅ **No timeouts** - API calls wait indefinitely for response
✅ **Play/Pause control** - Users can pause and resume audio
✅ **Visual feedback** - Icon changes based on playback state
✅ **Single playback** - Only one audio plays at a time
✅ **Automatic cleanup** - Resources properly disposed
✅ **Reactive UI** - Icon updates automatically with GetX observables
✅ **Platinum feature protection** - Only platinum users can use voice feature

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Click volume icon to start playback
- [ ] Verify icon changes to pause when playing
- [ ] Click pause icon to pause audio
- [ ] Verify icon changes back to volume when paused
- [ ] Click another message's volume icon while one is playing
- [ ] Verify first audio stops and second starts
- [ ] Verify non-platinum users see upgrade prompt
- [ ] Test with long text (no timeout issues)
- [ ] Test error handling (invalid URL, network issues)
- [ ] Verify audio stops when navigating away from screen

## Notes

- The `flutter_tts` package is no longer used
- All voice generation goes through the API
- Audio playback uses `audioplayers` package
- State management uses GetX reactive programming

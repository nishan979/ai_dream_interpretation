## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (Stable channel)
- An editor (VS Code, Android Studio, etc.)
- Platform-specific tools (Xcode for iOS, Android SDK for Android)

Ensure your environment is set up by running:

```bash
flutter doctor
```

### Installation & Run

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nishan979/ai_dream_interpretation.git
cd ai_dream_interpretation
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

Run the app (choose the device/emulator first):

```bash
flutter run
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

This application requires a custom backend server to handle AI processing, authentication, and audio generation.

Open the environment configuration file at `lib/constants.dart` and set the `baseUrl` constant to point to your backend's URL.

For local testing with the Android Emulator: use `http://10.0.2.2:PORT`.

For local testing with the iOS Simulator: use `http://localhost:PORT`.

The client sends auth tokens as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` headers for protected endpoints.

If you'd like, I can also:

- Add `assets/ss/` to `pubspec.yaml` and create a PR.
- Insert small non-comment no-op exception handlers to silence `empty_catches` analyzer warnings.
- Migrate deprecated `speech_to_text` usages to the newer `SpeechListenOptions` API.

Tell me which of those you'd like me to do next and I'll prepare a PR.

# AI Dream Interpretation

A Flutter app that interprets dreams using an AI-backed server and provides audio playback and speech features.

This README is intentionally complete and contains setup, build, troubleshooting, and publishing guidance so you can publish directly to GitHub.

## Important automated edits performed (please read)

Before publishing you should be aware that an automated maintenance pass was run across the repository. The pass made the following non-functional/source-only edits:

- Removed all debug `print(...)` and `debugPrint(...)` statements.
- Converted `Color.withOpacity(x)` usages to `Color.withAlpha((x*255).toInt())` per a requested rule.
- Stripped most comments (line `//` and block `/* ... */`) from active source files.

All original files modified by this process were copied into `.comments_backup/` at the repository root. If you need to restore any original file (with comments), you can copy it from that directory.

Example restore command (PowerShell):

```powershell
# Restore a single file from backup
Copy-Item -Path .\.comments_backup\lib\app\modules\auth\controllers\auth_controller.dart -Destination .\lib\app\modules\auth\controllers\auth_controller.dart -Force
```

If you want me to revert specific files automatically or generate a human-facing changelog listing exact diffs, tell me and I'll prepare a PR.

## Quick start (development)

Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (use a stable release compatible with Dart SDK `^3.8.0` â€” see `pubspec.yaml` environment).
- Platform SDKs for your targets (Android SDK for Android, Xcode for iOS, Visual Studio for Windows, etc.).

Verify your environment:

```powershell
flutter doctor
```

Clone and run

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/nishan979/ai_dream_interpretation.git
cd ai_dream_interpretation
flutter pub get

# Run on the default connected device
flutter run
```

Builds

Android APK (release):

```powershell
flutter build apk --release
```

iOS (release):

```powershell
# On macOS with Xcode configured
flutter build ios --release
```

Web (Chrome):

```powershell
flutter run -d chrome
```

Windows:

```powershell
flutter run -d windows
```

## Static analysis and formatting

Run the analyzer and formatter:

```powershell
flutter analyze
flutter format .
```

Notes:

- After comments were removed, `flutter analyze` may report `empty_catches` in a few places since some suppression comments were removed. I can either re-insert small no-op handlers (for example `final _ = e;`) or restore the original comments from `.comments_backup`.
- There are also a few `deprecated_member_use` notices around the `speech_to_text` plugin (it suggests migrating to `SpeechListenOptions`). I can update that code if you want.

---

## Tests

Run tests:

```powershell
flutter test
```

The repo contains a basic `test/widget_test.dart`. Add more unit / widget tests to `test/` as needed.

---

## Suggested CI / GitHub Actions

Minimal `flutter analyze` + `flutter test` workflow:

```yaml
name: Flutter CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
   analyze-and-test:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v4
         - uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
            with:
               flutter-version: 'stable'
         - name: Install dependencies
            run: flutter pub get
         - name: Analyze
            run: flutter analyze
         - name: Run tests
            run: flutter test --reporter=expanded
```

I can add this workflow to `.github/workflows/flutter-ci.yml` in a PR if you'd like.

## Troubleshooting common issues

- Missing asset at runtime: confirm path declared in `pubspec.yaml` and run `flutter pub get`.
- Microphone / audio permission issues: confirm runtime permissions are requested (the app uses `permission_handler`).
- Audio served via ngrok: if you get HTML instead of audio, ensure your backend returns a direct audio URL or include the `ngrok-skip-browser-warning=true` cookie when fetching bytes.
